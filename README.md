# 🔬 Telemetry

> Bridge to google analytics. Because sdks are black boxes

### Reasoning
- 🤖 App intelligence. How people are using an app. What to improve etc
- 🐛 Error and crash reporting. Get ahead of bad UX by getting notified if there are bugs
- 🌍 Usage data. Which markets are using the app. Improve the app for that market etc

> **Warning**  
> Currenly using GA3 API which is sunset in July. This lib will migrate to GA4 before that

### Events
With the Telemetry's event() method, you can monitor any event you want.
```swift
Telemetry.event("Authorize", action: "Access granted")
```

### Screenviews
You should frequently keep track of the "screens" the user navigates to. Your ViewController's viewDidAppear is a logical place to do that. The Telemetry's screenView() method can be used; it performs the same function as event().
```swift
Telemetry.screenView("Cheers")
```

### Sessions
By calling session(start: true) when the user opens the application and session(start: false) when they close it, you can keep track of each user's individual sessions. You can do this in your UIApplicationDelegate application by following the example given here:.

```swift
Telemetry.trackerID = "UA-XXXXX-XX")
Telemetry.session(start: true) // applicationDidBecomeActive
Telemetry.session(start: false) // applicationDidEnterBackground
```

### Exception
Use exception to report warnings and errors
```swift
Telemetry.exception("Error - database not available", isFatal: false)
```

### Timing
```swift
// Add example for this later
```

### Gotchas:
- Telemetry will automatically request that Google Analytics anonymize user IPs in order to comply with GDPR.
The token can be obtained from the admin page of the tracked Google Analytics entity.
- Firebase crashlytics is the way to go now days. Its also free to use etc. But can be over the top complex. You have to use their SDK etc. Sometimes simple is better etc.
- When setting up google analytics account. Make sure to use legacy `Universal Analytics property` and not GA4. This legacy option is under advance menu when you setup the account
- Why are closed source sdks bad? From apples app-review guidelines: `Ensure that all software frameworks and dependencies also adhere to the App Store Review Guidelines`
