# ðŸ”¬ Telemetry

> Bridge to google analytics. Because sdks are black boxes

### Events
With the Telemetry's event() method, you can monitor any event you want.
```swift
Telemetry.event("Authentication", action: "Sign Up Completed")
```

### Screenviews
You should frequently keep track of the "screens" the user navigates to. Your ViewController's viewDidAppear is a logical place to do that. The Telemetry's screenView() method can be used; it performs the same function as event().
```swift
Telemetry.screenView("Beer")
```

### Sessions
By calling session(start: true) when the user opens the application and session(start: false) when they close it, you can keep track of each user's individual sessions. You can do this in your UIApplicationDelegate application by following the example given here:.

```swift
Telemetry.trackerID = "UA-XXXXX-XX")
Telemetry.session(start: true) // applicationDidBecomeActive
Telemetry.session(start: false) // applicationDidEnterBackground
```

### Gotchas:
- Telemetry will automatically request that Google Analytics anonymize user IPs in order to comply with GDPR.
The token can be obtained from the admin page of the tracked Google Analytics entity.
- 
- Firebase crashlytics is the way to go now days. Its also free to use etc. But can be over the top complex. You have to use their SDK etc. Sometimes simple is better etc.

### Todo:
- Add documentation to this readme on how to setup Google analytics for your google account etc
- Seems like 
- Combine telemetry with logger tests. And test for errors and warnings etc
- improve documentation
